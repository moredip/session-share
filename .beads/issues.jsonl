{"id":"session-share-99v","title":"Special-case rendering for Read tool (tracer bullet)","description":"Implement expand/collapse UI for Read tool calls in session-viewer. When collapsed, show CC TUI-style summary like 'Read(/file/path)'. When expanded, show full input/output as today. This is a tracer bullet - once Read works, we'll follow the same pattern for other tools.\n\n## Game Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Create Sample Data\n1. Craft a prompt that exercises the Read tool in various ways (different file types, with/without line limits, etc.)\n2. Run it in a fresh CC session\n3. Export the session using /export\n4. Save the JSONL transcript to samples/ for future reference\n\n### Phase 2: Understand CC's TUI Rendering\n1. Look at how CC displays Read tool calls in the terminal\n2. Document the exact format (e.g., Read(/path/to/file) or Read(/path, lines 1-50))\n3. Identify what metadata we need from the tool call to replicate this\n\n### Phase 3: Implement Collapsed Summary for Read\n1. Create a helper function to generate the TUI-style summary string for Read tool calls\n2. Modify ToolCallEntry component to use expand/collapse pattern\n3. When collapsed: show icon + summary string (e.g., 'Read(/file/path)')\n4. When expanded: show existing detailed view\n\n### Phase 4: Test \u0026 Polish\n1. View sample session in session-viewer to verify rendering\n2. Test edge cases (long paths, paths with special chars, line ranges)\n3. Ensure expand/collapse animation is smooth\n\n## Future Work (not this ticket)\n- Apply same pattern to: Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task, WebSearch, WebFetch\n- Each tool will need its own summary format function","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"git@thepete.net","created_at":"2026-01-28T10:56:10.540359-08:00","created_by":"Pete Hodgson","updated_at":"2026-01-28T11:05:09.515468-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-28T11:05:09.515468-08:00","close_reason":"Tracer bullet complete: Read tool now shows TUI-style collapsed summaries.
