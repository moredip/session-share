More specifically, palm sugar rounds out sweet balance and tames the chili heat; kaffir lime leaves provide bright citrusy zing and aromas that pop; lemongrass offers a grassy, lemony scent that's oddly refreshing; and galangal or ginger provides a warm, piney bite.\n\n### Textures\nThe consistency of its sauce varies with the amount of coconut milk used.(no content)Coconut milk creates a rich, creamy base for the curry.\n\n### Aromas\nIt is very fragrant from all the herbs and aromatics in the curry paste, and has a more fragrant presence with chilli than Thai Yellow Curry.(no content)Green curry paste is traditionally made by pounding green bird's eye chillies, shallots, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime peel, cilantro roots (coriander), cumin seeds, white peppercorns, shrimp paste and salt, and the paste is fried in split coconut milk until the oil is expressed to release the aromas in the paste.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"743f7c36-16ea-434e-bb34-a8abda0b9899","timestamp":"2026-01-22T21:19:46.788Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7a9516af-8ddf-40f6-ab33-9fc2112c215f"}

The flavors encompass **spicy, salty, sweet, and umami** all at once. Its texture is **silky and luxurious** from the coconut milk, and its aroma is particularly prized for being more **fragrant** than other Thai curries.\n\nSources:\n- [Green curry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_curry)\n- [Thai Green Curry - RecipeTin Eats](https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-green-curry/)\n- [Green Thai Curry Recipe - Hot Thai Kitchen](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/green-curry-new-2/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1068,"cache_read_input_tokens":8915,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1068,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXP7dfnH6TaGp5k4sYLkw","type":"assistant","uuid":"fc9d250d-58c6-410f-b84f-a92efe49834e","timestamp":"2026-01-22T21:19:54.360Z"}
