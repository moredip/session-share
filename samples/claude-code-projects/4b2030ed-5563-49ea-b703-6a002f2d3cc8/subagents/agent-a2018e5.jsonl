Despite being the spiciest of the main Thai curries, its balance of heat with sweetness from coconut milk and lime juice makes it a fan favorite.\n\n2. **Red Curry (Gaeng Phet)** - A close second in popularity. Known for its bold, robust flavor and medium-hot spice level, it's a staple at Thai restaurants worldwide.\n\n3. **Massaman Curry** - Extremely popular, especially in Western countries. It won CNN's \"World's 50 Most Delicious Foods\" poll in 2011, ranking #1. Its mild, sweet, and aromatic profile (blending Thai and Indian influences) makes it accessible to those who don't enjoy high spice levels.\n\n4. **Yellow Curry (Gaeng Karee)** - Popular as a beginner-friendly option due to its mild flavor profile with turmeric and curry powder.\n\n5. **Panang Curry** - Another highly popular option, known for its thick, creamy texture.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nWhile **Green Curry** is generally considered the most popular overall in terms of global orders and recognition, **Massaman Curry** has gained significant acclaim and was famously voted the world's most delicious food. **Red Curry** rounds out the top three as a consistent favorite.\n\nThe popularity can vary by region - in Western countries, milder curries like Massaman and Yellow tend to be very popular among newcomers to Thai cuisine, while Green Curry remains the iconic choice for those who enjoy spicier fare.\n\nSources:\n- [The Ultimate Guide to Thai Curries - Inquiring Chef](https://inquiringchef.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-thai-curries/)\n- [A Beginner's Guide to Thai Curries - Rickshaw](https://www.rickshawatl.com/a-beginners-guide-to-thai-curries-green-red-and-everything-in-between)\n- [The Ultimate Guide to Thai Curries - Thai Ginger](https://thaiginger.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-thai-curries/)\n- [How to Choose the Perfect Thai Curry - Marion's Kitchen](https://www.marionskitchen.com/article/guide-to-thai-curries/)\n- [Thai Curry Spice Differences - Rosa's Thai](https://rosasthai.com/news-and-events/thai-curry-spice-differences)\n- [Flavorful and Popular Types of Thai Curry - Mekhala Living](https://mekhalaliving.com/flavorful-and-popular-types-of-thai-curry-a-culinary-guide/)\n- [Thai Curries in Order of Spiciness - Essy Cooks](https://essycooks.com/which-thai-curry-is-spiciest/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1115,"cache_read_input_tokens":11560,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1115,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":7,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXMBreafaZBamzVxwx3fr","type":"assistant","uuid":"c4f5cf99-9122-458c-a67c-e97604b9d5ca","timestamp":"2026-01-21T20:54:11.344Z"}
