Its golden color and warm flavors come from turmeric and curry powder.\n\n**Red Curry:** Red curry is known for its bold, spicy flavor. Made from red chili peppers, it has a rich, deep color and a robust taste.\n\n**Green Curry:** Apart from being the hottest of all curries, the sweet green curry is delicious as it uses copious amounts of coconut milk and lime juice.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8ebee896-b109-44cf-88ef-caa9ea757239","timestamp":"2026-01-21T20:53:58.821Z"},"normalizedMessages":[{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-21T20:53:26.621Z","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","id":"msg_01EwzvVEp8xhADrb1AKmgfNP","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01PQqfNyi6Re4Pmw55BUHr5i","name":"WebSearch","input":{"query":"most popular Thai curry color green red yellow massaman ranking"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11560,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11560,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"requestId":"req_011CXMBp6HuXp8E3DCMiECE5","uuid":"b611587c-78af-482b-854f-d200a8c56582"},{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01PQqfNyi6Re4Pmw55BUHr5i","type":"tool_result","content":"Web search results for query: \"most popular Thai curry color green red yellow massaman ranking\"\n\nLinks: [{\"title\":\"The Ultimate Guide to Thai Curries\",\"url\":\"https://inquiringchef.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-thai-curries/\"},{\"title\":\"A Beginner’s Guide to Thai Curries: Green, Red, and Everything in Between\",\"url\":\"https://www.rickshawatl.com/a-beginners-guide-to-thai-curries-green-red-and-everything-in-between\"},{\"title\":\"The Ultimate Guide to Thai Curries | Thai Ginger\",\"url\":\"https://thaiginger.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-thai-curries/\"},{\"title\":\"How to choose the perfect Thai curry to suit your tastebuds\",\"url\":\"https://www.marionskitchen.com/article/guide-to-thai-curries/\"},{\"title\":\"Understanding the Differences Between Thai curry - Thai Banana Leaf\",\"url\":\"https://thaibananaleaf.com/understanding-the-differences-between-red-green-yellow-and-massaman-curry-a-guide-by-banana-leaf-thai/\"},{\"title\":\"Thai Curry Spice Differences: Red, Green and Yellow | Rosa's Thai\",\"url\":\"https://rosasthai.com/news-and-events/thai-curry-spice-differences\"},{\"title\":\"Flavorful and Popular Types of Thai Curry: A Culinary Guide\",\"url\":\"https://mekhalaliving.com/flavorful-and-popular-types-of-thai-curry-a-culinary-guide/\"},{\"title\":\"Types of Thai Curries - Understanding The Difference | Nittaya Thai Curry\",\"url\":\"https://www.nittayathaicurry.com/articles/types-of-thai-curries-understanding-the-difference/\"},{\"title\":\"Understanding Thai Green vs Red vs Yellow Curry » Smashing Eats\",\"url\":\"https://smashingeats.com/thai-green-vs-red-vs-yellow-curry/\"},{\"title\":\"Thai Curries in Order of Spiciness: Which Thai Curry Is Spiciest?
